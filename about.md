I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Santa Clara University. I specialize in:

- Full-Stack Web Development (React, Next.js, Tailwind, Django)
- Cloud Solutions (AWS, GCP, CI/CD, Docker)
- AI/ML Engineering (OpenAI, YOLOv8, Hugging Face)

Previously worked at Advancedware Technologies where I built scalable CRM platforms supporting 100K+ daily transactions.
